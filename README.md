# A-PathFinder-on-Crime-Analysed-Montreal-Map
The purpose of this project is to generate a crime risk map and use it to help in navigation from one coordinate to another using an optimal heuristic search algorithm. The crime risk map allows to visualize the places in Montreal which have high crime rates and need to be avoided.
